        </h1>
        <p>Surrounded by snow-capped mountain peaks, deep-blue waters and swaths of evergreen forests, Seattle is as wild as it is trendy. Our Hotel puts you in the heart of the cityâ€™s downtown, with the Seattle Art Museum on one side, iconic Pike Place Market on another and the waters of Elliott Bay gleaming to the west.</p>
        <p>Wake to a fresh cup of coffee delivered straight to your room, then head out to explore eclectic neighbourhoods and craft breweries, or spend the day hiking up nearby Mount Rainier or kayaking on Lake Union.</p>
        <p>Come nightfall, meet us at Goldfinch Tavern, an Ethan Stowell Restaurant, and let our chefs show you all the best local flavours of your new favourite city.</p>
